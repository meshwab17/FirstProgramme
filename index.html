<p>The default remote is the remote of the remote-tracking branch of the current branch. If no such remote-tracking branch exists or the HEAD is detached, "origin" is assumed to be the default remote. If the superproject doesn’t have a default remote configured the superproject is its own authoritative upstream and the current working directory is used instead.</p>
<p>The optional argument is the relative location for the cloned submodule to exist in the superproject. If is not given, the canonical part of the source repository is used ("repo" for "/path/to/repo.git" and "foo" for "host.xz:foo/.git"). If exists and is already a valid Git repository, then it is staged for commit without cloning. The is also used as the submodule’s logical name in its configuration entries unless --name is used to specify a logical name.</p>
